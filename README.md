DESCRIPTION:

KBord is a simple, anonymous text-based chat board.

This project, constantly updated with new "boards", works to allow users to submit text-based posts that are then able to be queried, (in progress) replied to, and interacted with.
Consisting of multiple boards regarding different topics, this project was born out of my interest in making such a chat room one day - and thus I decided to start my first public 
web-development project with this. It simply works by storing messages with semi-randomized IDs corresponding to the boards they are posted in, which are then able to be queried by
these IDs.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

To use this project, simply download the overarching file, import it into an IDE like Eclipse that supports static or dynamic web development with HTML, CSS, and JS, and launch the
included HTML pages within your web browser for testing.

WORKING ON:

- Integrating data persistence across different devices, as opposed to just saving messages to localStorage.
- Integrating partial instead of requiring literal querying.
- Generally cleaning up and making the site look presentable.
